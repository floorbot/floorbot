// First, define a type that, when passed a union of keys, creates an object which
// cannot have those properties. I couldn't find a way to use this type directly,
// but it can be used with the below type.
export type Impossible<K extends keyof any> = { [P in K]: never; };

// The secret sauce! Provide it the type that contains only the properties you want,
// and then a type that extends that type, based on what the caller provided using generics.
export type NoExtraProperties<T, U extends T = T> = U & Impossible<Exclude<keyof U, keyof T>>;
